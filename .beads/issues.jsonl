Creative Alternatives\n\n**\"Crew\" / \"Add to Crew\"**\n- Fits production/creative industry language\n- Implies collaboration, working together\n- Could be asymmetric (\"They're on my crew\")\n\n**\"Circle\" / \"Inner Circle\"**\n- Community-oriented language\n- Tiered possibilities (close circle vs wider)\n- Google+ baggage though\n\n**\"Know\" / \"I know them\"**\n- Authentic real-world language\n- \"People you know\" feels natural\n- Awkward as action verb\n\n**\"Admire\"**\n- Positive, non-hierarchical\n- Fits appreciating others' work\n- One-way, like favorites\n\n### 5.

When someone signs up using your invite code, it gets marked as \"used\" and cannot be reused.\n\n**Q: How many invites can I create?**\nA: You can create up to 3 invite codes at a time. Once an invite is used by someone, you can create a new one.\n\n**Q: Can I see who used my invite?**\nA: Currently, you can see if an invite has been used, but not who used it.\n\n### Account\n**Q: How do I reset my password?**\nA: Password reset is not yet implemented. Contact support for help.\n\n**Q: Can I change my email?**\nA: Email changes are not currently supported.\n\n### Profiles\n**Q: How do I add a profile photo?**\nA: Go to Settings and paste a URL to your profile image. We currently support URL-based images (e.g., from Gravatar, social media, or hosted services).\n\n**Q: What are job functions?**\nA: Job functions describe what you do creatively - Designer, Writer, Musician, etc. You can select multiple.\n\n### Events\n**Q: Who can create events?**\nA: Any member can create events for the community.\n\n**Q: What does \"Approval required\" mean?**\nA: Event organizers can require approval before someone can attend. This helps manage capacity and ensure the right fit.","created_at":"2026-01-25T06:37:20Z"}]}
