# Organization Tiers Strategy

## Overview

Wonderwall is a two-sided marketplace connecting Kingdom-minded creatives with organizations that want to hire them. This document outlines the strategic thinking behind our organization tier structure.

## Multi-Stakeholder Analysis

### 1. Non-Christian Businesses (Secular Companies)

**Why they'd join:**
- Access to values-driven, dependable talent with strong work ethic
- Creatives known for integrity and honesty
- Differentiated hiring pool from generic platforms

**Concerns:**
- May feel alienated by overly religious language
- Might wonder if they're "welcome"
- Don't want to be perceived as exploiting faith

**What they need:**
- Clear messaging that they're welcome ("For Any Organization")
- Professional framing emphasizing values-alignment
- Low barrier to entry to test the waters

### 2. Churches

**Why they'd join:**
- Natural fit for hiring worship teams, media, communications
- High trust factor
- Community connection

**Concerns:**
- Often budget-constrained
- May not have many hires per year

**What they need:**
- Affordable or free entry tier
- Low commitment options

### 3. Christian-aligned Nonprofits

**Why they'd join:**
- Mission alignment
- Want talent that understands ministry context

**Concerns:**
- Budget conscious
- May have irregular hiring needs

### 4. Non-Christian Nonprofits

**Why they'd join:**
- Values-driven workers with strong ethics
- Environmental, social justice orgs may value ethical talent

**Concerns:**
- Cultural fit questions
- May not fully understand platform

### 5. Christian Creatives (Supply Side)

**What they want:**
- VOLUME of job opportunities (more orgs = more chances)
- Diversity of org types (not just churches)
- Secular opportunities to live out faith in workplace
- Quality, interesting work
- Fair compensation

**Concerns:**
- Too few organizations = too few jobs
- Only church jobs limits career growth

## "Skin in the Game" Analysis

### Arguments FOR a Free Base Tier

1. **Network effects require volume** - Two-sided marketplaces need critical mass
2. **Lowering barriers accelerates adoption** - Especially for hesitant secular businesses
3. **Creatives benefit directly** - More orgs = more job opportunities
4. **"Test the waters" option** - Non-Christian businesses can explore before committing
5. **Small org accessibility** - Churches and nonprofits with tight budgets can participate
6. **Enables rapid directory population** - AI scraper can add orgs with minimal friction
7. **Clear upgrade path** - When orgs see value, upgrading is simple

### Arguments AGAINST a Free Tier

1. **No financial commitment** - May lead to low-quality listings
2. **Perceived value** - Free things are often seen as less valuable
3. **Quality control** - Could attract spam or irrelevant organizations
4. **Never-pay risk** - Organizations without budget might never actually hire

### Decision: Strategic Free Tier with Constraints

A "Community" tier that's free but constrained:
- Directory listing only (no logo, no profile page)
- Cannot post jobs (must upgrade)
- Requires verification (real org check)

This solves the volume problem while maintaining quality through paid tiers.

## Final Tier Structure

| Tier | Price | Sponsored Creatives | Target Audience |

| **Community** | Free | — | Testing interest, small orgs |

| **Patron** | $5,000/year | 10 | Established orgs investing in community |

## Patronage Model

Inspired by Renaissance patrons like the Medicis, organizations can become "patrons of the arts" by sponsoring memberships for emerging creatives.

### Benefits for Organizations
- Tangible ministry impact ("We sponsored 20 creatives this year")
- Builds loyalty with future hires
- Tax-deductible giving
- PR/marketing value ("Patron of Kingdom Creatives")
- First look at emerging talent

### Benefits for Creatives
- Removes financial barrier to entry
- Creates connection with sponsoring organization
- Validates their work ("Hillsong Sponsored Creative")
- Full platform access

### Implementation
- Sponsored creatives receive full platform access
- Organizations can either:
  1. Sponsor specific creatives they want to cultivate
  2. Contribute to a general scholarship pool

## Pricing Rationale

### Competitive Landscape

| Organization | Corporate Membership/Sponsorship |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| AIGA (design association) | $5K-$50K+ |
| Behance/Adobe partnerships | $25K-$100K+ |
| SALT Conference (church creative) | $10K-$50K sponsors |
| Christian music festivals | $25K-$100K+ title sponsors |
| Hillsong Conference sponsors | $15K-$75K+ |

### Target Organizations for Founding Partner

These organizations have marketing budgets in the millions—$25K is a rounding error:
- Life.Church, Elevation, Hillsong (church creative agencies)
- Lifeway, David C Cook (Christian publishers)
- Compassion International, World Vision (major nonprofits)
- Chick-fil-A, Hobby Lobby (values-aligned secular brands)
- Christian universities with media programs
- Worship software companies (Planning Center, ProPresenter)

## Future Considerations

### Wonderings Privacy Toggle

**Problem:** Creatives may self-censor because employers can see personal/vulnerable posts (Wonderings).

**Solution:** Add visibility toggle on Wonderings:
- **Public** (default): Everyone including organizations can see
- **Connections Only**: Only connected creatives can see

This preserves authentic community while letting creatives control their professional image.

### AI-Powered Organization Onboarding

To rapidly populate the directory:
1. Organizations express interest via URL submission
2. AI scrapes website for org info, logo, description
3. Pre-populate profile for quick verification
4. Reduces friction for Community tier signups
