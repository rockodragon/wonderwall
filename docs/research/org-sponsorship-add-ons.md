## Customer Discovery Questions

### Interest & Motivation

1. If you could sponsor additional creative memberships beyond your tier, would that interest you? Why or why not?

2. What would motivate you to sponsor more creatives? (Brand visibility, talent pipeline, mission alignment, tax benefits, other?)

3. Would you prefer sponsoring creatives in specific disciplines (designers, videographers, etc.) or general sponsorship?

### Selection & Matching

4. Would you want to hand-pick which creatives you sponsor, or have Wonderwall match you with creatives who need support?

5. Would you want any ongoing relationship with the creatives you sponsor? (Mentorship, first-look at their work, nothing?)

6. How important is it that sponsored creatives know who their sponsor is?

### Pricing & Structure

7. What feels like fair pricing for sponsoring an additional creative membership? ($10/mo? $20/mo? Something else?)

8. Would you prefer monthly flexibility or commit annually for a discount?

9. Would you rather buy a fixed package (10-pack, 25-pack) or add seats one at a time?

### Objections & Concerns

10. What would make you hesitant to sponsor additional creatives?

11. What reporting or proof of impact would you need to feel good about this investment?
