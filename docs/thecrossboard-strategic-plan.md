**THE CROSSBOARD**

*Strategic Plan for Organization Engagement & Monetization*

Deep Research & Strategic Recommendations

# **Executive Summary**

The Crossboard represents a unique opportunity in the faith-based creative economy: a LinkedIn-meets-Behance platform specifically for Kingdom creatives. This plan outlines a phased approach to monetization that balances mission with sustainability, starting with low-friction membership models and expanding into organizational sponsorships, job marketplace features, and potentially 501(c)(3) status.

**Key Recommendations:**

* Launch with individual memberships at $50/year (your current plan) as a foundation  
* Create tiered organization sponsorship levels from $500-$5,000/year  
* Delay becoming a payment handler initially; enable direct creative-client connections  
* Pursue 501(c)(3) status for donations and grants, with a separate LLC for marketplace activities

# **Market Analysis: Comparable Platform Models**

Understanding how similar platforms monetize provides the strategic foundation for The Crossboard's approach. Here's what the research reveals:

## **LinkedIn Premium Company Pages**

* $70-100/month ($840-1,200/year) for company pages  
* Features: Custom CTAs, testimonials, auto-invite followers, visitor insights  
* Best for medium/large enterprises; overkill for small businesses  
* Key insight: Premium subscriptions generated $2B in revenue for LinkedIn

## **Upwork (Marketplace Model)**

* Client fee: 5-8% on all payments to freelancers  
* Freelancer fee: 0-15% variable based on supply/demand  
* Contract initiation fee: $0.99-$14.99 per new contract  
* Escrow-based payment protection builds trust between parties

## **Behance (Portfolio \+ Hiring)**

* Free job postings for employers  
* Platform fee on projects: 10% \+ $2 (under $500), 5.5% ($501-2,500), 3% (above $2,500)  
* Behance Pro: 0% platform fees for subscribers  
* 40+ million members; primarily monetized through Adobe Creative Cloud integration

## **Dribbble (Designer Marketplace)**

* Hiring: $299/month for job board OR designer search  
* Combined hiring package: $499/month  
* Adobe Talent (comparable): $399-$1,499/month  
* Shop feature allows designers to sell digital assets directly

## **Faith-Based Creative & Church Job Platforms: Competitive Analysis**

The faith-based employment landscape includes several specialized platforms. Here's what we learned from researching each:

### **CRTVCHURCH** - The Creative Church Community
*crtvchurch.com | 92K Instagram followers*

**What They Are:** Global community platform and job board specifically for church creatives—the largest job board for church creatives seeking positions in churches.

**Business Model:**
* Free job searching for applicants
* Paid job posting for employers
* Newsletter subscription for engagement
* Multi-channel community (Facebook, Instagram, Discord)

**Key Lessons:**
* **Niche focus wins:** Specializing in one sector creates stronger community cohesion
* **Multi-channel engagement:** Job board + newsletter + social community creates sticky retention
* **Mission-aligned positioning:** Explicitly connecting career placement with spiritual growth resonates
* **Creator-led credibility:** Founder Nik Goodner's personal branding builds trust in niche communities

**Overlap with Crossboard:** HIGH - They target church creatives specifically. However, Crossboard is broader (Kingdom creatives across all industries) and portfolio-focused (Behance model) vs. pure job board.

**Differentiation:** Crossboard offers portfolio showcase + professional networking, not just job matching. CRTVCHURCH is job-first, community-second. Crossboard is community-first, jobs-integrated.

### **JustChurchJobs** - Ministry-Focused Employment
*justchurchjobs.com*

**What They Are:** The largest ministry-focused job board serving churches. Emphasis on pastoral, worship, children's ministry, and student pastor roles.

**Pricing:**
| Plan | Cost |
|------|------|
| Basic Posting | $150/30 days |
| Ministry & Education | $250 |
| Wide Reach | $500 (includes international distribution) |

**Key Features:**

* **Free search, paid posting** model is proven sustainable
* They charge $150-500 per job post—validates market willingness to pay

**Overlap:** LOW - They focus on pastoral/ministry staff roles, not creative professionals. No portfolio features.

**Differentiation:** Crossboard targets creatives (designers, filmmakers, artists) regardless of whether they work in churches. JustChurchJobs is church staff only.

---

### **ChurchStaffing.com** - Largest Church Employment Platform
*churchstaffing.com*

**What They Are:** Self-described "largest online job search website for church jobs, pastor jobs, and ministry jobs."

**Features:**

* Denomination-specific filtering

**Lessons:**
* **Additional services** (background checks, assessments, salary data) create upsell revenue
* **Denomination filtering** is table stakes for church hiring
* **Transition guidance** shows value of supporting the full hiring journey, not just matching

**Overlap:** LOW - Same as JustChurchJobs, focused on church staff not creatives.

---

### **OSCAR (UK)** - International Mission Opportunities
*oscar.org.uk/opportunities*

**What They Are:** UK's largest advertiser of Christian jobs and opportunities in mission, ministry, and church work. 339 current listings spanning paid jobs, voluntary roles, short-term missions, gap years, internships, and long-term placements.

**Business Model:** Advertising fees from organizations + possible membership services.

**Key Insight:** They cast a wider net than typical church boards—featuring mission agencies, educational institutions, charitable trusts, and parachurch organizations. International focus (Asia, Africa, Europe).

**Lesson for Crossboard:** Consider including mission organizations and parachurch ministries as organization sponsors, not just churches.

---

---

### **Christian Creative Directory Opportunities**
*opportunities.christiancreativedirectory.com*

**What They Are:** Job board specifically for Christian creatives—"The #1 place for Christian creatives to find work." Hosts roles in acting, animation, design, videography, worship, writing, marketing.

**Differentiator:** Unlike broad church boards, they emphasize creative disciplines. Include film submissions, theatre casting, entertainment roles beyond church employment.

**Overlap with Crossboard:** HIGH - This is our closest competitor. They target the same audience: creative professionals with faith commitments.

**Our Advantage:** Crossboard combines job board + portfolio showcase + professional networking + community feed. They're jobs-only with a separate directory. We're an integrated platform.

---

### **Christian Creative Network**
*christiancreativenetwork.com/opportunities*

### **SALT Community** - Church Creatives & Tech Leaders

**Business Model:** Membership-based with tiered access to training content and community features.

**Key Insight:** They position creativity not as a "marketing tool to attract people" but as "a vehicle for God to communicate powerfully and intimately to His people." This mission-first framing resonates deeply with creatives.

**Overlap with Crossboard:** MEDIUM - They serve church production/tech teams primarily. Crossboard serves individual creatives across all industries (not just church staff). SALT is training-focused; Crossboard is portfolio/networking-focused.

**Differentiation:** Crossboard connects creatives with hiring organizations; SALT equips existing church teams. They're complementary—a creative might use SALT for skills and Crossboard for opportunities.

---

### **Something More Creative**
*thereissomethingmore.com*

**What They Are:** Media brand and design agency (Something More Creative®) plus ethical merchandise company (Something More Supply®). Not a jobs platform.

**Relevance:** They represent the TYPE of organization that would be Crossboard sponsors—faith-based creative agencies seeking talent.

---

## **Competitive Positioning Summary**

| Platform | Focus | Creative Portfolio? | Pricing Model | Crossboard Overlap |
|----------|-------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| CRTVCHURCH | Church creatives | No | Free search, paid posts | HIGH - same audience, different approach |
| JustChurchJobs | Ministry/pastoral roles | No | $150-500/post | LOW - different roles |
| ChurchStaffing | Church staff broadly | No | Tiered subscriptions | LOW - different roles |
| OSCAR | Mission opportunities | No | Advertising fees | LOW - different focus |
| ChristianJobs UK | UK faith employment | No | £100/post | LOW - geographic, role difference |
| Christian Creative Directory | Creative professionals | Directory only | Paid posting | HIGH - closest competitor |
| Christian Creative Network | Freelance matching | No | Donations/shop | MEDIUM - similar mission |
| SALT Community | Church creative/tech teams | No | Membership tiers | MEDIUM - training focus, complementary |

## **What Makes Crossboard Unique**

1. **Portfolio-first approach:** We're Behance + LinkedIn, not just a job board
2. **Professional identity:** Members build creative portfolios and professional presence
3. **Community feed:** Social engagement beyond job searching
4. **Integrated hiring:** Organizations see portfolios, not just resumes
5. **Broader creative scope:** Not limited to church roles—any Kingdom creative work
6. **Values-aligned matching:** Connecting based on faith alignment and creative fit

## **Alternative Positioning: "Upwork for Christian Creatives"**

An alternative framing positions Crossboard as "Upwork for Christian creatives"—a marketplace where organizations can find and hire vetted, values-aligned freelance talent.

**Upwork Model Parallels:**
* Talent search and filtering by skills, experience, location
* Project-based and ongoing work opportunities
* Portfolio verification and reviews/ratings
* Direct messaging and proposal system

**Key Differences from Upwork:**
* Values-alignment as core filter (not just skills/price)
* Community-first, not transaction-first
* No race-to-the-bottom pricing—quality over cheapest bid
* Relationship-building beyond individual gigs
* Mission-driven creatives, not mercenaries

**When This Positioning Works:**
* Pitching to organizations with immediate hiring needs
* Explaining value to non-creative stakeholders
* Competing against secular freelance platforms

**When Portfolio/Community Positioning Works Better:**
* Attracting creatives to join (they don't want to be "freelancers on a gig platform")
* Building long-term engagement and retention
* Differentiating from transactional job boards

**Recommendation:** Use "Upwork for Christian creatives" in B2B sales conversations, but maintain "LinkedIn + Behance for Kingdom creatives" for member acquisition and community positioning.

# **Understanding What Creatives Want**

## **The Creative Sweet Spot: Gifts × Calling × Income**

Kingdom creatives are searching for work that exists at the intersection of three circles:

```
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │   USING THEIR   │
        │     GIFTS       │
        │ (Skills, talent,│
        │   craft mastery)│
        └────────┬────────┘
                 │
    ┌────────────┼────────────┐
    │            │            │
    │     ╔══════╧══════╗     │
    │     ║   SWEET     ║     │
    │     ║   SPOT      ║     │
    │     ╚══════╤══════╝     │
    │            │            │
┌───┴────────┐   │   ┌────────┴───┐
│ FULFILLING │   │   │  GETTING   │
│  CALLING   │───┴───│   PAID     │
│ (Purpose,  │       │ (Sustain-  │
│  meaning,  │       │  able      │
│  Kingdom   │       │  income)   │
│  impact)   │       │            │
└────────────┘       └────────────┘
```

**The Pain Points:**
* **Gifts without calling:** Technically skilled work that feels meaningless
* **Gifts without pay:** Volunteering forever, can't sustain a living
* **Calling without gifts:** Heart for ministry but lacking craft mastery
* **Calling without pay:** Burnout from unpaid Kingdom work
* **Pay without gifts:** Soul-crushing work that doesn't use their talents
* **Pay without calling:** Making money but feeling purposeless

**What Crossboard Enables:**
* **Discovery of opportunities** that align with all three (job board + portfolio)
* **Community validation** that their creative work IS Kingdom work
* **Sustainable income** through values-aligned organizations willing to pay fairly
* **Professional development** through peer connections and feedback

**Messaging Implication:** Speak to all three desires. Don't just be a job board (pay). Don't just be a portfolio site (gifts). Don't just be a ministry (calling). Be the intersection.

#

# **The Crossboard's Unique Positioning**

The faith-based creative professional market is currently underserved. While platforms like GodKulture (network), Church Media Squad (subscription service), and Christian Creative (agency) exist, none offer a true LinkedIn/Behance hybrid for Kingdom creatives.

| Platform Element | Mainstream Equivalent | Crossboard Advantage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Professional Profile | LinkedIn | Faith-centered identity |
| Portfolio Display | Behance / Dribbble | Ministry-aligned work showcase |
| Hiring Marketplace | Upwork / Fiverr | Values-aligned talent matching |
| Social Feed | Instagram | Curated, edifying content |

# **Recommended Revenue Model**

## **Tier 1: Individual Memberships**

Your $50/year individual membership is well-positioned. For comparison, LinkedIn Career Premium is $30/month, making $50/year extremely accessible for the value provided.

| Membership Level | Price | Features |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Free Tier | $0 | Basic profile, limited portfolio (3-5 projects), browse jobs |
| Kingdom Creative | $50/year | Unlimited portfolio, apply to jobs, verified badge, messaging, analytics |
| Creative Pro | $120/year | Featured placement, advanced analytics, early job access, custom domain |

## **Tier 2: Organization Sponsorship Levels**

This is where the real opportunity lies. Churches, ministries, Christian media companies, and faith-based nonprofits need talented creatives and will pay for access.

| Sponsorship Level | Annual Price | Benefits Included |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **SOWER** (Entry) | $500 | Organization profile page, post 3 jobs/year, logo in directory, access to creative search |
| **BUILDER** (Growth) | $1,500 | Unlimited job posts, featured org badge, priority support, talent matching assistance, quarterly newsletter feature |
| **STEWARD** (Partner) | $3,000 | All Builder benefits \+ homepage feature rotation, sponsored content posts, early access to new features, dedicated account manager |
| **KINGDOM BUILDER** (Title) | $5,000+ | All Steward benefits \+ naming rights for events/features, advisory board seat, custom integrations, branded talent pipeline |

# **Payment Handling Strategy**

**Should The Crossboard become a money handler in transactions?**

## **Phase 1: Connection Model (Recommended Start)**

Start by facilitating connections without handling payments. This approach mirrors early LinkedIn and reduces regulatory complexity.

* **Pro:** No payment processing licenses, escrow requirements, or money transmission concerns  
* **Pro:** Lower liability and operational overhead  
* **Pro:** Focus resources on community building and engagement  
* **Con:** Less control over transaction quality and disputes  
* **Con:** Can't capture transaction fees as revenue

## **Phase 2: Integrated Payments (Future State)**

When ready to handle payments, use Stripe Connect or Mangopay for marketplace escrow:

* Client pays into escrow when project starts  
* Funds held until work approved  
* Platform takes 5-10% transaction fee (similar to Behance/Upwork)  
* Built-in dispute resolution

**Recommendation:** Launch without payment handling. Add it in Year 2-3 once you have proven demand and transaction volume to justify the infrastructure investment.

# **501(c)(3) Analysis: Should You Pursue It?**

The decision between nonprofit and for-profit structures significantly impacts fundraising, operations, and growth. Here's a nuanced analysis:

## **Benefits of 501(c)(3) Status**

* **Tax-deductible donations:** Donors can deduct contributions up to 60% of their income  
* **Grant eligibility:** Access to foundation and government grants  
* **Public trust:** Nonprofit status signals mission over profit  
* **Tax exemption:** No federal income tax on mission-related revenue  
* **Faith alignment:** Religious/charitable purpose fits Kingdom creative mission

## **Challenges of 501(c)(3) Status**

* **No private benefit:** You cannot personally benefit financially beyond reasonable salary  
* **Board governance:** Minimum 3 directors required; must follow strict governance rules  
* **Annual reporting:** Form 990 required; finances become public  
* **Limited lobbying:** Political activity heavily restricted  
* **Dissolution limits:** Assets must go to another nonprofit if organization closes

## **Recommended Structure: Hybrid Model**

Consider a hybrid structure with two related entities:

| The Crossboard Foundation (501c3) | The Crossboard LLC (For-Profit) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Receives donations Applies for grants Funds scholarships for creatives Sponsors community events Educational programming | Operates platform technology Collects membership fees Processes sponsorship payments Handles marketplace transactions Pays licensing fee to Foundation |

This structure allows donations AND commercial revenue, maximizing flexibility while maintaining mission integrity.

# **Organization Pages: What to Offer**

Organization pages should feel premium while providing genuine value for hiring Kingdom creatives.

## **Core Organization Page Features**

1. **Ministry Profile:** Mission statement, values, denomination/affiliation, team photos  
2. **Project Showcase:** Highlight past creative work done by hired talent  
3. **Job Board Access:** Post positions, receive applications, track candidates  
4. **Talent Search:** Filter creatives by skill, location, availability, denomination  
5. **Testimonial Display:** Reviews from creatives who've worked with the org  
6. **Verified Badge:** Trust signal showing verified organization status

## **Premium Organization Features (Higher Tiers)**

* Featured placement in search results and homepage  
* Sponsored content posts in member feeds  
* Email blasts to creatives matching their criteria  
* API access for ATS integration  
* Dedicated talent concierge for high-volume hiring  
* Branded recruitment landing pages

# **Implementation Roadmap**

## **Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)**

* Launch individual memberships at $50/year  
* Build initial creative member base (target: 500 members)  
* Create basic organization profile pages  
* Enable direct messaging between orgs and creatives  
* Accept donations via simple Stripe integration

## **Phase 2: Monetization (Months 7-12)**

* Launch organization sponsorship tiers  
* Target 10-20 paying organizations in first year  
* Add job board functionality  
* File for 501(c)(3) status for foundation entity  
* Build email list and newsletter sponsorships

## **Phase 3: Scale (Year 2\)**

* Evaluate payment processing integration  
* Add escrow-based project marketplace if demand warrants  
* Launch premium individual tier ($120/year)  
* Apply for foundation grants  
* Host virtual events and conferences

# **Financial Projections: Year 1**

| Revenue Stream | Unit Price | Volume | Annual Revenue |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Individual Memberships | $50 | 300 | $15,000 |
| Sower Sponsorships | $500 | 10 | $5,000 |
| Builder Sponsorships | $1,500 | 5 | $7,500 |
| Steward Sponsorships | $3,000 | 2 | $6,000 |
| Donations (Foundation) | Varies | \- | $5,000 |
| **TOTAL YEAR 1 REVENUE** |  |  | **$38,500** |

**Note:** These are conservative estimates. With strong execution, Year 1 could exceed $50K. Year 2-3 projections with payment processing and grants could reach $100-150K annually.

# **Recommended Next Steps**

7. **Create /organizations landing page** explaining sponsorship benefits and tiers  
8. **Design sponsorship brochure PDF** for outreach to churches and ministries  
9. **Build prospect list** of 50 potential organization sponsors  
10. **Set up Stripe for memberships and sponsorships** (simple checkout, no escrow yet)  
11. **Consult with nonprofit attorney** about hybrid structure timing  
12. **Draft /donate page** to accept donations for mission work  
13. **Create sample organization profile mockup** to show sponsors what they get  
14. **Plan soft launch announcement** to Focus26 network and Christian creative communities

**Bottom Line:** Start with $50/year individual memberships and tiered organization sponsorships ($500-$5,000). Avoid payment handling complexity initially. Consider 501(c)(3) for a foundation entity that can receive donations while keeping marketplace operations in an LLC.
